Description: Surveys are used to teach sampling distributions and selection biases
   all the time, but illustrating a sampling distribution is difficult (because often
   we only have one survey) and most simulations are unrealistic. This package 
   provides some ready-made datasets from the CCES and Census-related datasets
   along with some customizable sampling schemes, using DeclareDesign.
